My old friend and sometimes co-host, Robert Worstell, returns and we explore the topic of research, especially from the angle of learning how to write fiction, and writing in general.

Over the years Robert has rolled up his sleeves and plunged into many subject areas to establish for himself what the underlying principles are that allow one to master the subject or action, used what he learned to be effective in the field, and then shared what he learned with others. In the process he has published an impressive volume of books, articles and stories, and learned to make a reasonable living doing so, sharing what he has learned so that others can benefit from what he finds.

In our discussion we also get in pretty close to the essence of what makes the pair of concepts "technology" and "choice" such a powerful tool to examine how to do things.
