Is Economics an ideology or a technology, a science or a religion? Is there some foundational principle of Economics upon which everyone can agree? Why is the subject of Economics so contentious?

We explore these and other questions with our guest, Bob Murphy. Bob is a bona fide professional economist with tons of academic credentials and a lot of experience breaking the subject down for "the rest of us."

To help anchor the subject we talk quite a bit about his fabulous book, *Choice: Cooperation, Enterprise and Human Action.* 

Followers of this show will recognize immediately, *he had me at Choice!*

Anyway, we had a lot of fun and hope it is a useful conversation for you.
