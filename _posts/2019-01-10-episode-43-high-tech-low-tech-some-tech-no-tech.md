John and Robert probe questions regarding the level of technology appropriate to different situations, and we try to isolate some touchstones for selecting the right type, level and amount technology to employ.

As fodder we talk a lot about Robert's different situations as simple farmer on the one hand, and as a writer, publisher and internet marketer on the other.

We'd really like the input from the listeners on what you think about and how you find the balance. Email at simpleton@safecrossroads.net.
