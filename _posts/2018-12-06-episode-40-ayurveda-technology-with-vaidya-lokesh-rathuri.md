Ayurveda is a practice for maintaining and restoring health with origins dating back 10,000 years. It has been practiced consistently since. Might there be something to learn here? Might it offer choices for health and healing which are not available in the modes and institutions which most of us are used to?

I recently had the privilege of meeting and interviewing a Vaidya (practitioner/doctor) of Ayurveda, Lokesh Rathuri. He presents the basic understandings on which Ayurveda is built, in a way that opens the subject for a beginning understanding. It is a different view than most in the West are used to. You get to decide where there is merit there to warrant further exploration. We also discuss the interface of eastern and western practices and how they can inform each other's understanding and practice.
